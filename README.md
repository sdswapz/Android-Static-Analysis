![alt text](https://github.com/sdswapz/poppy_seed/blob/master/docs/images/logo.png)

What is poppy seed?
-----------
Poppy seed is an abstraction of malware analysis tool. We need to start from somewhere right, so we started this program development with an Android OS platform (keeping the cost of implementation and research into consideration). Next is IoT, followed by iOS!

Why poppy seed?
-----------
Because according to the Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poppy_seed) it provides 'supposed magical powers of invisibility' and who does not love invisiblity, am I right!! Including malware authors but this poppy seed app will help you unveil the magic cloak around malware apps. 

Development
-----------

This is a live repository and I promise atleast a commit every two months. But keep in mind currently there is only one author to this project. And that f*$@er has a day job (slacking off ofcourse) but I promise I will do my best to expediate this development. 

Contributors are always welcome, we need expertise for following, 
1. Python developer
2. Malware specalist 
3. Django front end developer (I know Django is a subset of Python but I just feel like give it a shout out)
4. Docker 

Development plan 

Android malware development plans is simple, I am going to break it into three phases,
1. Discovery of security controls enforced (obfuscator, packer, protector)
    Timline: 8th Dec 2017 will be released before BSides Philly
2. Static analysis of Android application to detect malware 
    Timline: 30th Janurary 2018 will be released before (will release it soon)
3. Dynamic analysis of Android application to detect malware and its behaviour 
    Timline: 8th April 2018 will be released before (will release it soon)

Demo, presentation slides and example will be shared and uploaded on this pages!! YAH!!!

Documentation 
-----------

I am currently using github pages for adding my brain dump. I understand this is not a sustainable one but it works for now, I guess.

License
-----------
I have very liberal views around licensing agreements or someone using the code to expand on something I missed out on. I am learning from the community and I want to contribute back to it by removing barrier to entry around what I developed. However if I have any dependencies we all must and have to comply to there licensing agreement.
